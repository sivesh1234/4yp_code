1. Streamlit: Both "streamlit_app.py" and "run_scripts.py" will require the Streamlit library for creating the web interface and running the app.

2. Python Scripts: Both files will need access to the same repository of Python scripts. This is a shared resource that both files will interact with.

3. Script Execution Function: A function (e.g., "run_script") that executes a given Python script will be shared between the files. "streamlit_app.py" will call this function based on user input, and "run_scripts.py" will define and implement it.

4. User Input: The name of the Python script to be run will be a shared variable, as it will be inputted by the user in the Streamlit interface ("streamlit_app.py") and used to run the script in "run_scripts.py".

5. Error Messages: Any error or success messages (e.g., "Script executed successfully", "Script not found") will be shared between the files, as they will be defined in "run_scripts.py" and displayed in the Streamlit interface ("streamlit_app.py").

6. Streamlit Widgets: The id names of Streamlit widgets (e.g., selectbox for script selection, button for script execution) will be shared between the files, as they will be defined in "streamlit_app.py" and their states (e.g., selected script, button click) will be used in "run_scripts.py".
